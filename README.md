# Fuzzy's Media Organizer

The program checks the folders within a directory to determine what movies / tv shows are present.
It then pulls poster art from the folder and also reads a .nfo file for information on that movie.

## Some improvements include

- [x] DB should be local

### Movies

- [x] Sort by column clicking instead of buttons
- [x] Column for video quality (720p, 1080p etc) that just checks video file
- [x] Have genres work like tags, so I can add or remove genres from a list of acceptable genres
- [x] 5 star rating system that allows half stars
- [x] Quicker updates or auto updates, should pull the plot and genres
- [x] Filtering
- [x] Pin movies or mark them to put them in a shortlist (like if I want to watch it soon like My List on netflix)
- [x] Fun stats like watch count of a movie, total number of movies, watched X / Y, X%, etc
- [x] Runtime
- [x] Should be visual distinction for movies that are deleted
- [x] Allow user to delete the movie through the program, which dupes the poster and stores it so you can still visually see it in the program

### TV Shows

- [x] Display thumbnails / posters for these too
- [x] Mark if the series is ended or not
- [x] Way to indicate if new episodes have been added since last time watching the show
